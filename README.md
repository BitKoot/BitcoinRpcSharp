BitcoinRpcSharp
===============

A wrapper for the bitcoind JSON RPC interface written in C#.

Please be careful when using this library, as some functions can really mess up your wallet. I have used and recommend the testnet in a box (https://github.com/freewil/bitcoin-testnet-box) for development.
